 3. Machine Translation Encoder/Decor: Capstone project from Imperial College London's "Customizing Your Models With Tensorflow 2" class on coursera.
    - https://github.com/mvenouziou/Project-Language-Translation
 
 4. Text Generation: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to produce computer-generate poetry and other text. (Tensorflow + Tensorflow Probability + web app implementation.)
    - https://github.com/mvenouziou/Project-Text-Generation

 5. Style Transfer: Alter an image using textural elements from a second image using transfer learning. (Tensorflow + web app implementation.)
