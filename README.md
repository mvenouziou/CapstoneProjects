 5. **Text Generation: Recurrent Neural Networks** to produce computer-generate poetry and other text. (Tensorflow + Tensorflow Probability + web app implementation.)
    - https://github.com/mvenouziou/Project-Text-Generation

 6. **Neural Style Transfer:** Alter an image using textural elements from a second image using transfer learning. (Tensorflow + web app implementation of the original approach.)
