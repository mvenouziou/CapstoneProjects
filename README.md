# Capstone_Projects

 1. Final project from Wesleyan University's full Data Analysis and Interpretation specialization on Coursera: Tackles a DrivenData.org project to classify repair status of water pumps in Tanzania. The project includes a full written report of findings as well as a predictive model for use in the competition. (Scikit-Learn)
