# Capstone Projects

### [**Object Detection: DETR for Tensorflow**](https://github.com/mvenouziou/DETR_for_TF)
- Implementation of DETR object detection model in Tensorflow. This hybrid CNN / attention transformer model has been coded from first principles as presented in the paper *End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers (2020)* published by Facebook AI. 
 

### [**Image to Text Translation: Attention is What You Get**](https://github.com/mvenouziou/Project-Attention-Is-What-You-Get)
- Image CNN + Attention Encoder --> Attention + Dense text Decoder for the Bristol-Myers Squibb Molecular Translation challenge on Kaggle. Given a chemical diagram drawing, can we determine its specific molecule identification InChI code? 
- Model based on the papers *Attention is All You Need (2017)* and *Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention (2015)*


### [**Data Analysis and Classification: Predicting Water Reliability** ](https://github.com/mvenouziou/Project-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Classification)
- Capstone project from Wesleyan University's Data Analysis and Interpretation specialization on Coursera. Includes full written report (PDF) and Decision Tree-based predictive model.


### [**RNN Encoder / Decoder: English -> German Translation** ](https://github.com/mvenouziou/Project-Language-Translation)
- Capstone project from Imperial College London's "Customizing Your Models With Tensorflow 2" class on coursera.


### [**Neural Style Transfer: Web App**](https://github.com/mvenouziou/Project_Style_Transfer)
- Alter an image based on textural elements from a second image. (Web app implementation.)
